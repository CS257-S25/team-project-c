4/13/2025, Subject to change for the sake of efficiency or due to experience.

# Goals

- Learn how to clean and analyze a dataset.
- Develop full-stack programming skills for a site that is clear and deliverable.
- Complete a project about UFO data.

# Strengths

**Emma**: I took Human-Computer Interaction last term, so I’m experienced with user-friendly interfaces. I’m a good listener.  
**Ruby**: I’m good at coordinating people, generating ideas for how to approach a problem, and consistently putting in work on a problem.  
**Jocelyn**: I’m good at cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing datasets with tools such as Excel, RStudio, and Tableau.

# Roles

There are only three of us, so we will rotate roles and learn from each other—at least until we all have a strong understanding of each other’s strengths and weaknesses. At that point, we will assign more permanent roles.

- **Emma**: Taking notes for our meetings.
- **Jocelyn**: facilite discussion.
- **Ruby**: Setting agendas.

# Rules

## Meetings

Besides meeting in class, we will meet at least once per week outside of class to check on project progress. The meeting schedule will depend on the difficulty of the project and how much direct collaboration is helpful.

## Communication

We will share all our work in a Google Drive folder accessible to all group members. In weekly meetings, we will ensure everyone is on the same page and discuss next steps. We will also take meeting notes in case someone misses a meeting. We have a group chat to communicate about meeting times, deadlines, and other updates.

Being respectful means recognizing the ideas, work, and contributions of our teammates, learning from each other, and handling conflicts in a friendly manner. Do not insult others for any reason, and try to talk through any difficulties in group tasks.

We will check in at least once a week and try our best to have everyone attend the meeting.

## Technologies

- Google Drive
- Zoom (only if it's really inconvenient to meet in person)
- GitHub
- VS Code
- Message

## Decision-Making

Since it's a group of three people, we will make decisions unanimously. If someone disagrees with an idea, we will hold a meeting to discuss and develop new ideas.

## Delegation

We will try to divide the work evenly, taking into account personal preferences, abilities, and time availability.

We will assign work properly and have weekly check-ins to ensure the team is making progress and to work through any difficulties together.

As long as every group member is spending a similar amount of time on the project each week (accounting for task difficulty), that counts as satisfactory participation.

## Conflict Resolution

We will communicate our expectations and politely ask the person to revise their part. We’ll work together to improve the project. Each part of the project will be labeled to track contributions.

We will be respectful and try to communicate clearly. If needed, we will talk to Anya for help.
